## **Summary**
The spread of dementia across different demographics appears to be associated with only 
certain groups. The data sets used were sourced from Kaggle which contained de-identified data
of a selection of patients. The data sets were individually analyzed and graphed to show relationships between the prevalence of dementia among different groups. From this, it was found that people with the gene APOE e4 are much more common among people with dementia.

## **Overview**
Though commonly thought of as a disease, dementia is more of a group of symptoms 
that impair cognitive function. These symptoms may be caused by a variety of other
diseases, such as Alzheimer's, Huntington's, Lewy body, or multiple of these combined.
It is unfortunately associated with the misconception that it comes naturally with age.

Dementia is characterized by the main symptoms being:

      - Memory loss
      
      - Communication problems
      
      - Confusion or disorientation
      
      - Difficulty with certain tasks
      
      - Problems with movement
      
      
These symptoms can negatively impact a person's life. It can make everyday tasks that
were once easy seem difficult. 

Now, with Dementia being considered a very common condition, it is more important than
ever to understand the spread of this disease.

Interestingly, most other groups do not appear to have significant correlation between the populations of people with and without Dementia, except for the variable of having APOE e4. APOE e4 is a gene that is associated with a greatly increased risk for Alzheimer's.
