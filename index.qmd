Though commonly thought of as a disease, dementia is more of a group of symptoms 
that impair cognitive function. These symptoms may be caused by a variety of other
diseases, such as Alzheimer's, Huntington's, Lewy body, or multiple of these combined.
It is unfortunately associated with the misconception that it comes naturally with age.

Dementia is characterized by the main symptoms being:

      - Memory loss
      
      - Communication problems
      
      - Confusion or disorientation
      
      - Difficulty with certain tasks
      
      - Problems with movement
      
      
These symptoms can negatively impact a person's life. It can make everyday tasks that
were once easy seem difficult. 

Now, with Dementia being considered a very common condition, it is more important than
ever to understand the spread of this disease.
